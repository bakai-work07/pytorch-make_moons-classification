## ðŸŸ¢ Simple Neural Network Classification on make_moons (PyTorch)
This is my implementation of a neural network classifier for the classic make_moons dataset using PyTorch. The project is inspired by the tutorial "PyTorch for Deep Learning & Machine Learning â€“ Full Course" by Daniel Bourke.

The main purpose of this mini-project is to deepen my understanding of:
- PyTorchâ€™s model and training loop (forward pass, loss, backward pass, optimizer step)
- Binary classification using sigmoid activation
- Using BCEWithLogitsLoss for binary tasks
- Saving and reloading model weights
- Visualizing binary decision boundaries

ðŸ§  Key Concepts Practiced
- Using make_moons for noisy non-linear binary classification
- Building a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with ReLU activations
- Predicting binary labels using sigmoid + rounding
- Writing a custom accuracy function and training loop
- Saving models with torch.save() and visualizing predictions with a decision boundary plot
